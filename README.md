##### Status of this project

ðŸš¨ Beta ðŸš€

At the moment, there are zero known issues with jbrotli and all 90+ unit tests are passing green.

###### Jan.2016

    When I did high throughput and highly concurrent benchmarks with the HTTP servers (see below),
    I observed peak memory usages over 32GByte, which killed my JVM. I've searched for memory leaks,
    but couldn't found any orphan objects after comparing heap dumps.
    Unfortunately there isn't that much documentation on memory usage available. Which makes it difficult
    to understand why there are such peaks and if these are "normal".
    
    I don't recommend to use jbrotli in projects with many and highly concurrent compression tasks.
    
    
##### Example usage in HTTP servers

* There's a [patched Tomcat server](https://github.com/nitram509/tomcat80) which makes use of jbrotli.
* There's a [patched Undertow server](https://github.com/nitram509/undertow) which makes use of jbrotli.


## About Brotli

Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm,
Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods.
It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.

It was developed by Google and released in September 2015 via this blog post:
[Introducing Brotli: a new compression algorithm for the internet](http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2015/09/introducing-brotli-new-compression.html)


## Using jbrotli

##### Maven
jbrotli releases are available at [bintray](https://bintray.com/nitram509/jbrotli/jbrotli/)

In order to use, simply add these lines to your project's pom.xml:

```xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.meteogroup.jbrotli</groupId>
      <artifactId>jbrotli</artifactId>
      <version>0.3.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>bintray-nitram509-jbrotli</id>
      <url>https://api.bintray.com/maven/nitram509/jbrotli/jbrotli</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
```

jbrotli's pom.xml will automatically select the native library,
depending on your platform's operating system family and arch type (Java property *os.arch*).
For a list of supported platforms, look for released ```jbrotli-native-*``` artifacts at 
[jbrotli's bintray repository](https://bintray.com/nitram509/jbrotli/jbrotli#files/com/meteogroup/jbrotli).


##### Example of regular BrotliCompressor with custom dictionary

```java
NativeLoader.loadLibrary("brotli");

byte[] inBuf = "Brotli: a new compression algorithm for the internet. Now available for Java!".getBytes();
byte[] compressedBuf = new byte[2048];
BrotliCompressor compressor = new BrotliCompressor();
int outLength = compressor.compress(Brotli.DEFAULT_PARAMETER, inBuf, compressedBuf);
```


##### Example of BrotliStreamCompressor using default dictionary
 
```java
NativeLoader.loadLibrary("brotli");

byte[] inBuf = "Brotli: a new compression algorithm for the internet. Now available for Java!".getBytes();
boolean doFlush = true;
BrotliStreamCompressor streamCompressor = new BrotliStreamCompressor(Brotli.DEFAULT_PARAMETER);
byte[] compressed = streamCompressor.compressBuffer(inBuf, doFlush);
```
